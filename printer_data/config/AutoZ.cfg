#nozzle_xy_position:   <X,Y position for clicking the nozzle on the z endstop - not needed if [safe_z_home] is used>
switch_xy_offsets:    <X,Y offsets from the nozzle position for clicking the probe's switch body on the z endstop>
#bed_xy_position:      <X,Y position for probing the bed, for instance the center point - not needed if mesh with zero_reference_position is used>
switch_offset:        <offset of the switch trigger (read the Switch Offset section!)>
start_gcode:          <macro name for attaching the probe>
#before_switch_gcode: <macro name for attaching the probe AFTER probing the nozzle>
end_gcode:            <macro name for docking the probe>
